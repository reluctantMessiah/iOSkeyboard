# iOSkeyboard

This keyboard was a school project. It was designed for someone who could type with only one hand and with rough movements.
This project was my first time writing in Swift, and my first iOS project.
To try out the keyboard, run the project in XCode. In the simulator, install the keyboard named "KeyPad" in general settings menu.
